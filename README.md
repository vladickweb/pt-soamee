# Test Case to Soamee



## Instalation
Clone repository
```bash
cd <folder-where-you-are-going-to-clone-repository>
git clone https://github.com/vladickweb/pt-soamee
cd pt-soamee
```
Install dependencies

```sh
cd client
npm i
cd ..
cd server
npm i
```

run server
```sh
cd server
npm start
```

run client from another terminal
```sh
cd client
npm start
```

*By default the server starts on port 5005 and the client on port 3000, this can be changed in the configuration files. The .env is published so that the company can test it. This is done thoroughly.*
